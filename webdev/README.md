# Olympics Analysis -- Web Development

## Overview of Olympic Medal Predictions analysis 
The purpose of the Olympic Medal Predictions analysis was to develop a website to (1) honor the splendor, camaraderie, and beauty of the Olympics, and (2) showcase our team's (Team Red) interest in applying machine learning models to predict medaling in the Olympic games. The website features four individual webpages:

 - The "Home" page welcomes visitors to the website, introduces visitors to the purpose of the Olympic Medal Predictions analysis, and features our ordinal regression model to predict the chances of winning gold for actual gold medal winners from the PyeongChang 2018 and Tokyo 2020 games

 - The "About Us" page acquaints visitors with the members of Team Red and our unique contributions to the website 

 - The "Data Viz" page provides visitors with a deep dive into a Tableau story chronicling our data analysis and visualization journey

 - The "Interact!" page allows visitors to experience our Easy Ensemble Classifier machine learning model in order to discover whether or not they could medal (gold, silver, or bronze) in a winter or summer Olympics sport. The page features two interactive, dynamic forms where visitors can enter their and/or other biometric data and obtain a prediction result of whether or not they would medal in a winter or summer Olympic sport.
