            <h3 class="curtis-header">Curtis Dean&#129351;</h3>
            <p class="curtis">My responsibilities for this project were largely related to EDA, plus any associated visualizations, and git workflow. I utilized R’s Tidyverse 
              (mostly dplyr and ggplot) packages in my analysis. The first step was to determine how much of the data to use. I analyzed the percentage of missing values in biometric 
              categories (age, height, weight) vs. the percentage of the overall data and developed a staggered bar chart to make the decision-making easier. I recommended 1964 as the 
              cutoff point, since it allowed us to remove around 85% of the missing values, while maintaining 70% of the overall data points. Next, we needed to determine how to handle 
              Olympic sports/events. For example, Alpine Skiing (sport) has 6 different events. In some cases, it was reasonable to collapse the different events into a single “event 
              category,” while other times the sport was too broad and not at all representative of the different events. These sports were identified by looking at the summary statistics 
              of the biometric data for each event, partitioned by “sex” of the participants. We ultimately decided to remove “team sports” (like Baseball) from the dataset and create 
              subcategories for sports with large variances in biometric data across the associated events. Finally, I created our GitHub repository and have been responsible for creating/merging 
              feature branches and dictating git workflow.</p>

            <p class="sapana">My journey through this project led me down an unexpected life-altering path...one that I could not have predicted at its outset. I decided to take on the role of 
              building our website that included both front end and back end web development tasks. My intention was to craft a website that would (1) generate excitement for the upcoming Beijing 
              Olympics 2022; (2) provide a unique, beautiful sensory experience for the user by including music and visually appealing content; and (3) showcase the special talents, hard work, and 
              brilliance of my fellow teammates. As the web developer, I was responsible for completing the technical coding of each webpage comprising our website in HTML and CSS; building a Flask 
              app in Python that would run our website on a server; channeling my passion for creativity and artistry into web design; and utilizing project management and leadership skills to effectively 
              collaborate with, encourage, and support my fellow team members both individually and collectively. I am extremely proud of the amazing efforts and phenomenal work of my teammates. But, most 
              of all, I am thrilled that this experience has awakened and illuminated a career path for me that encompasses everything I love most, i.e., creativity/artistry, data management and quality 
              assurance, implementing and honing technical skills, working both independently and collaboratively with others; and participating in bringing complex project ideas to life. As a result 
              of my participation in this group project, I am now embarking on a new adventure towards pursuing a career as a full-stack web developer!

              Hi, I’m Mona. For this project I have worked on a machine learning prediction model of winning a medal based on a person’s biometric data. 
              I first label encoded the data, then split the dataframe into winter and summer data and then trained and tested the data. I created a make_pipeline 
              and used Iterative Imputer, StandardScaler and models in the pipeline. The two models I used were Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier 
              for predicting a person’s chances of winning a medal, which gave a very low recall score. i.e., for winter RFC 31% and DTC 35% and for summer RFC 26% and 
              DTC 34%. To improve the performance of our model, I used the combination of oversampling the minority (Medal) class and undersampling the majority (no medal) 
              class. I applied SMOTE for over sampling and RandomUnderSampler for under sampling, which gave me 69% for winter and 65% for summer data. I absolutely enjoyed 
              working with the immensely talented team.</p>

              My responsibilities for this project included aiding the exploratory data analysis group and creating the Tableau visualizations. 
              For EDA, I used Python and matplotlib to familiarize myself with the data and review the sports with the highest number of unique 
              events for our Event Category field. As the team wrapped up our EDA, machine learning model, and website deployment, I used Tablaeu 
              to tell the story of how we got from point A to point B in terms of our original dataset and final dataset. I really enjoyed showcasing 
              the team's hard work in Tableau, while simultaneously providing the end user with information about both our project and the Olympic athletes' 
              biometric data!</p>

              My responsibilities for this project were to support the machine learning team to create a model to predict if a person would win a medal based 
              on the bio-metric data (age, height, weight) they enter. I have explored multiple ways to encode the data, impute the null values and create a 
              model that works with our data. I had an amazing experience discovering the process of creating a model and all the pre-processing steps that go 
              in it.</p>

              My tasks for this project were aiding the exploratory data analysis group and creating the ordinal regression model. 
              The data we used contained a number of former countries in the dataset that would detract from the model so I assigned 
              each former sovereign country's data to the countries that inherited their history the most. I also created the ordinal 
              regression model that creates predictions of a person's chances at winning different olympic medals, which was an incredibly 
              interesting process. While in the end we were unable to deploy the model in an interactable form, I’m very pleased to still 
              show some results!</p>
